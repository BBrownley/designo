# Designo - Digital Design Agency Website

[Live site](https://www.brownley.dev/designo/)

This is a multi-page website for a fictitious design agency advertising their portfolio and company. This project was inspired from a challenge I completed on [Frontend Mentor](https://www.frontendmentor.io/), where I was given the design of the project as a Sketch file, and it was up to me to replicate the design using React and styled-components.

## Tech used

React, styled-components, and the Leaflet API.  

## Why? What did I learn?

I used this project as an opportunity to help solidify my skills in working with React and styled-components together. I also wanted to build something that would resemble something that a client would pay for. Because the design was already given to me, it was easier for me to focus on the skills I wanted to improve on, the biggest one being page layout.

In this project I made several reusable components with React to do things such as have the Header and Footer appear on all pages of the site and display data from imported JSON. Through completion of this project, I learned how to work with images, make fluid responsive layouts, and have gotten a better understanding of what makes a website look good.
